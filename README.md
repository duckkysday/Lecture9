FramerX Rotate
How I did what I did:
  I first opened a new framer X file. Then, I created a new code component. I went in the code and added a rotate section. I defined the default as a number and set it to 40. This resulted in the original component to show up as rotated 40 degrees. I also changed the radius and background tint of the component. I "saved as" the file and pushed it to git.
  
  That's all folks!
